## Predicting Employee Promotion 


**Project description:** 
This project aims at building a Machine Learning model which can predict whether an employee should be promoted or not. 

**Data:** 
The training dataset contains information on 54,808 employees.
  
  It includes the following features: 
  
    Employee_id: Employee ID
    Department: Which department the employee belongs to 
    Region: Employee's office region
    Education: Employee's education level 
    Gender: Employee's gender 
    Recruitment_channel: Through which recruitment channel the employee was employed 
    No_of_training: Number of trainings the employee had received 
    Age: Age of the employee
    Previous_year_rating: Employee's previous year rating, ranging between 0 and 5 (with 5 being the best rating)
    Length_of_service: The number of years the employee has worked at the company
    KPIs_met >80%: Whether the employee has met more than 80% of KPIs 
    Awards_won?: Whether or not the employee has won an award before
    Avg_training_score: Employee's average training score 

 **Steps:**
 
Data Analysis
Feature Engineering (handle categorical variables and missing data, perform random oversampling to resolve imbalance in response variable)
Feature Selection
Building the model (Decision Tree)
